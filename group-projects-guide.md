# Group Projects Guide

This is a step by step guide to explain how group projects work.

## Step 0 - Before we start

It's Tuesday 6PM and you're supposed to do group work. You should pay attention to your group channel in Slack. We'll post a Zoom meeting link so you can join. **Everybody must join this meeting**. In the meeting, we'll be forming the groups and handing over the assignments for that day. Once you know who are going to be your teammates and you have the assignment, you can proceed to create your private conversations

## Step 1 - Create conversations with your group

Using Slack, and with the shortcut `cmd-shift-k` or `ctrl-shift-k` you can start a group conversation, as you can see in the following image:

Once you have your private conversation set up, it's time to create your own Google Hangout. One of you should start it and invite the other team members. To create a Google Hangout go to: https://hangouts.google.com/

## Step 2 - Forking the assignment repo

Once of you will be in charge of forking the repo containing the assignment. For this example we'll be using this repo: [https://github.com/rmotr-group-projects/pyp-w1-gw-language-detector](https://github.com/rmotr-group-projects/pyp-w1-gw-language-detector).

To fork it, just click on the "Fork" button, as you can see here:

Once you fork it, you'll have your "own personal copy" in your own Github Profile:

## Step 3 - Get to work

Make the modifications you want to your code and push all the changes. We recommend you to use Cloud9, as it's **FREE** and you can also collaborate with the rest of your teammates. To see a complete guide on how to set Cloud9 for your own project, see this guide: [http://blog.rmotr.com/students/2015/12/26/step-by-step-guide-to-configure-cloud9-for-group-projects/](http://blog.rmotr.com/students/2015/12/26/step-by-step-guide-to-configure-cloud9-for-group-projects/)

Once you finish making your changes, you'll see them in your repo and you'll be able to see how your fork "differ" from the original repo:

Once all the tests pass, you can now "deliver" your project by _sending a Pull Request_.

## Step 4 - Sending the Pull Request

To send a Pull Request, go to the _Pull Requests_ tab and click on the "New pull request" button:

You'll be prompted with a screen like the one in the following image, in which you'll see the changes you've made to the repo:

You can then review your changes an once you're sure, you can click on the "Create pull request" button. At that moment, you'll see the following screen. Please include your group number in the title and the team members in the description of it, along with any comments you want the reviewing team to see:

Once you create the Pull Request, you'll see something like this:

We'll be running the tests for you, so you can see them at the bottom of your PR:
