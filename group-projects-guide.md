# Group Projects Guide

This is a step by step guide to explain how group projects work.

## Step 0 - Before we start

It's Tuesday 6PM and you're supposed to do group work. You should pay attention to your group channel in Slack. We'll post a Zoom meeting link so you can join. **Everybody must join this meeting**. In the meeting, we'll be forming the groups and handing over the assignments for that day. Once you know who are going to be your teammates and you have the assignment, you can proceed to create your private conversations

## Step 1 - Create conversations with your group

Using Slack, and with the shortcut `cmd-shift-k` or `ctrl-shift-k` you can start a group conversation, as you can see in the following image:

Once you have your private conversation set up, it's time to create your own Google Hangout. One of you should start it and invite the other team members. To create a Google Hangout go to: https://hangouts.google.com/

## Step 2 - Forking the assignment repo

Once of you will be in charge of forking the repo containing the assignment. For this example we'll be using this repo: [https://github.com/rmotr-group-projects/pyp-w1-gw-language-detector](https://github.com/rmotr-group-projects/pyp-w1-gw-language-detector).
