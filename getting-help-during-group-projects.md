# How to get help during Group Projects

This is a simple step by step guide to get help from mentors while you're working on your group project. You're supposed to be working in a Google Hangout with your group. See more details about that in the [Group projects guide](https://github.com/rmotr/pyp-welcome-guide/blob/master/group-projects-guide.md)

## Step 1 - Join the #mentors-help channel

## Step 2 - Post a message including the HO link

Post a message requesting help from mentors. Please include the Google Hangout URL, so we can join.

## Step 3 - That's it!

That's it! Someone will join and provide help. You can leave the #mentors-help group if you don't want to be annoyed by other people's notifications.
